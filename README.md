Hi. Welcome to my repository, 
i had been trying to accomplish this project by myself this repo contains 
a simple game called The Simon Games. This game has a simple UI,there are colors 
that you need to remember the pattern, and the pattern will get harder by level you are about to complete! 
i gurantee you will never reach the highest level of mine, it was about 20 😎

Enjoy the game!! 🚀
